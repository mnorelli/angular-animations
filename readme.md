### Objectives
- Dynamically apply and remove css classes using `ng-class` (see Lesson 1)
- Animate elements with CSS transitions or keyframe animations (see Lesson 1)
- Learn how to do animations _the Angular way_


The following lesson was deconstructed and rebuilt in code from a nice online tutorial video.

#### Setup:
`bower init` (`enter` `enter` `enter`...)

Take a moment to look at your starter code `index.html`:

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head lang="en">
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Angular Animations</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
    </head>
    <body ng-app="app" ng-controller="AppCtrl">
        <h2>Angular Animations</h2>
        <button id="myButton" class="btn-primary">Click to fade</button>

        <div id="myBadge" class="badge">Fade me</div>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/gsap/src/uncompressed/TweenMax.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.min.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

```

As you can see, we're using a CDN for Bootstrap CSS (serving the file locally caused problems), an animation library called TweenMax, Angular of course and Angular Animate.

Let's fetch the code before we begin.

`bower install angular`
`bower install bootstrap`
`bower install gsap --save`  (for some reason TweenMax is an alias for GreenShock)
`bower install angular-animate`


Add the following to your empty `app.js` file as a sanity check:

```js
    var app = angular.module('app', ['ngAnimate']);

    app.controller('AppCtrl', function(){
        console.log('Angular is running');
    });
```

Now we can fire up the server and make sure things work.

`http-server`

We see the button and the badge. Let's wire up some animation.

### Step 1. jQuery Animation (not recommended)

We already know how to use jQuery animations. This will work with or without Angular.

```js
     $('#myButton').click(function (){
         TweenMax.to($('#myBadge'), 1, {opacity: 0});        
     });

```

Generally speaking, _using jQuery is not the Angular Way._


### Step 2. Let's remove jQuery 

The `.click` method can go. Let's add some Angular code to our controller, instead.

```js
    this.fadeIt = function(){
        TweenMax.to($('#myBadge'), 1, {opacity: 0});        
    }  

```

We need to call our new `fadeIt` function from the HTML. Where would you add this directive as an attribute?

```html
     ng-click="app.fadeIt()"
 ```

We also need to do something different with our `ng-controller` in order to call fadeIt on `app`:

```html 
     ng-controller="AppCtrl as app"
```

That should do the trick, but manipulating the DOM inside a controller is a bad idea for several reasons. The code is not reusable and it doesn't leverage the power of directives.


### Step 3. Let's leverage the power of directives!

The directive is to be called `hideMe`. (That's `hide-me` in the markup. Or `hide_me`. Or `hide:me`.)

```html
    hide-me="app.isHidden"
```

We'll also declare a variable `isHidden`, set it to `false` by default (thereby duck-typing it a Boolean) and we can toggle its value like so:

```js
    this.isHidden = false;

    this.fadeIt = function(){
        this.isHidden = !this.isHidden;
    };

```
The directive itself will look like this:

```js
app.directive("hideMe", function(){
    return function(scope, element, attrs){
        scope.$watch(attrs.hideMe, function(newVal){
            console.log(newVal);
            if(newVal){
                TweenMax.to($('#myBadge'), 1, {opacity: 0}); 
            }
        }); 
    };
});
```

You may use `scope` or `$scope`. At this level they are equivalent.

Angular's `$watch` service is like an event listener. By passing in `attrs` we can monitor any HTML attributes for changes in the current scope. When a change occurs, `$watch` recieves the new value and we can use that data to evoke changes in our app.

Now we have our custom directive but we're still calling it on a specific element in the DOM.

### Step 4. It's All You.

Now you need to pass `$animate` into our directive function. We can pass specific functionality to `$animate.addClass` and `.removeClass` using the `animation` service.
